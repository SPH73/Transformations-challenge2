After looking at the solution code, I learned that I could improve my code.
I had transform: rotate(360deg);
I only needed to apply animation: spin; in it's place and I didn't needed
animation-play-state: running;

I was happy to have the code working as per the challenge but it was quite
verbose. It's still easier to use all the properties at the moment.
